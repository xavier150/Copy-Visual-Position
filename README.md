# How it works
In Blender go to View3D > Tool > Copy Visual Position
There are two panels: 
**One by one** allows you to copy and paste the visual location, rotation and scale of a single object and to be able to modify the values before applying them.

**Packed** allows you to copy and paste the visual transform of serval objects.
This can be very useful in animation for the IK / FK switch and to move a parent object without moving the childs.
(Due to the hierarchy of certain objects it is sometimes necessary to click several times on the paste button)
